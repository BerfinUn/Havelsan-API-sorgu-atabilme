What's troublesome are wounds of the heart. Nothing is harder to heal. They're a bit different from physical injuries. You can't apply medicine for one thing and sometimes, they never heal. There's only one cure for a wound of the heart. \nIt's a bit bothersome and you can only receive it from someone else. What is it? Love."
